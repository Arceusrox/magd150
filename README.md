## Project 2 - Color Composition
This project's theme was space, so I designed a spaceship with two satellites hovering beside it, floating past a planet. I used a variety of colors.
## [Project 3 - Math](https://github.com/Arceusrox/magd150/blob/master/f18_magd150_lab03_dileo%20(4).zip)
This sketch's theme was bubbles. I made a sketch that would create bubbles when you left clicked the screen, and "pop" them when you right clicked a bubble.
## Project 4 - Dynamism
The theme for this one was oceans. I set the scene to be underwater and put two fish swimming across the screen constantly. If the mouse was clicked, the fish would change color.
## Project 5 - Intersections
The theme was television for this project. I turned the whole screen into a tv, with on and off buttons in the bottom left corner. If the button labelled "on" was clicked, the tv screen would turn white. If the "off" button was clicked, the screen would turn black.
## Project 8 - Text
This time the theme was movie posters. I made a poster for a Legend of Zelda movie, with fonts I found on dafont.com. If you clicked on the screen, the text would turn from white to yellow.
